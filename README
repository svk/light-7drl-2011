Control scheme hints (the game is otherwise undocumented):
    'a' uses a dungeon feature
    'x' uses an inventory item (slots listed at bottom of screen)
        [ drink potions, snuff out / light braziers and torches, etc. ]
    ',' picks up something from the ground

    Vi keys or numpad move

Feedback welcome, I'm usually in #rgrd on Quakenet (IRC)
